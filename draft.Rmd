# The Problem

In the recent years we observed arise of several R packages enhancing proces of writing R code. R programmers can now easily incorporate best programmer practices during the development of new tools. On the other hand, we see only a little improvement in the area of R tools designed to aid during the analysis of the data. Our aim is to create a new package responsible for managing the workflow of data analysis, from data pre-processing till reporting. 

## Key functionalies of the package

2. Isolating the workspace of the workflow (i.e. not by loading all packages, but only specific functions). 
1. Documenting and testing functions written for the purpose of an analysis.
1. Documenting data sets and reports.
2. Tracking the workflow - which functions, data sets are employed in the specific module of the analysis, what is the output of a module.
3. Caching results of the time-consuming procedures to speed up reiterating the workflow.
4. Preserving the past versions of the workflow.

## Similar projects

The functionalities helpful in the management data analysis are scattered among several packages, but only one package, [ProjectTemplate](http://projecttemplate.net/), aims directly to solve this problem. Nevertheless, our project cannot be perceived as a counterpart of *ProjectTemplate*, because we will focus on different aspects of the workflow management


# Overview

An analysis is never done in a single step. Instead, it is more complicated process, requiring moving back and forward, sometimes even drastic changes in a scope or a goal of the study. Our project will be focused on preserving these intermediate steps of formulating a final analysis workflow streamlining the return to previous solutions. 

The next problem of any analytic workflow is the management of the code involved in the analysis emplying often both functions from several packages and written specifically for the purpose of the current task. The former may create a namespace cluttered with many masked objects, the latter involves dealing with the untested code. We will provide users with the functionalies to keep the analysis enviroment clean and to both test and document their own code.

## Detailed description of the project

### Isolating the workspace of the workflow

Essentially add functions from the specific packages to the new namespace, that would have priority over default namespace (create pseudopackage for project). Maybe packrat for creating private library for the project.


### Documenting and testing functions written for the purpose of an analysis

The written on the fly functions tend to have much lower quality that functions coming from packages. The burden of writing proper documentation and argumement checks may seem unnecessary for the custom functions used in the analysis. The **reporteR** supports analysts by generating documentation for functions written using the roxygen standard.

Functions used in the reporteR-governed project should be documented using the roxygen standard. The tests for arguments via [checkmate](https://github.com/mllg/checkmate) package will be generated automatically during the documentation process.
